# RESTful API Development Project

## Introduction

In the evolving world of software development, understanding how to communicate and transfer data efficiently between systems is essential. This project delves into the domain of RESTful APIs, a cornerstone in the realm of web services. The **Representational State Transfer (REST)** architecture is a set of constraints that ensure a scalable, stateless, and cacheable communication system. This approach allows for the easy integration of web services, making them accessible to a wide range of applications.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain a deep understanding of the following:

1. **HTTP/HTTPS Basics**:
   - Understand how data transfer occurs via HTTP/HTTPS, and the difference between secure and non-secure versions.
   
2. **API Consumption with Command Line (curl)**:
   - Learn to interact with APIs using command-line tools, specifically `curl`, to fetch and manipulate data.

3. **API Consumption with Python**:
   - Use Python's `requests` library to fetch, process, and manipulate API data.

4. **API Development with http.server**:
   - Learn to develop simple APIs using Python's built-in `http.server` module to handle basic HTTP requests and responses.

5. **API Development with Flask**:
   - Build more complex, scalable APIs using the Flask framework, focusing on routing, data management, and scalability.

6. **API Security & Authentication**:
   - Implement basic and token-based authentication (JWT) for secure API access.

7. **API Standards & Documentation (OpenAPI)**:
   - Learn the importance of maintaining standardized API documentation for usability and maintainability.

## Importance

In today’s interconnected digital age, RESTful APIs are crucial for integrating different systems. They serve as the bridge between systems, translating requests into understandable actions, fetching data, or triggering procedures. APIs are used everywhere, from social media platforms sharing data to large industrial systems communicating for automation.

Developing a solid understanding of how to consume, develop, secure, and document these APIs equips you with an essential skill set, blending technical intricacies with high-level design, ensuring seamless and efficient communication in the digital world.

- **Client**: The requester of the service, typically a web browser or application.
- **Web Server**: Receives and forwards the request to the API Server.
- **API Server**: Processes the request, fetching or modifying data as needed.
- **Database**: Stores the data fetched or modified by the API.

## Project Structure

This project contains the following tasks:

### 0. Basics of HTTP/HTTPS

**Objective**: Understand the core principles of HTTP and HTTPS, including how data is transferred and the key differences between secure and non-secure communication.

- Learn HTTP methods and status codes.
- Explore packet sniffing tools like Wireshark (optional).
- Analyze HTTP requests and responses using browser developer tools.

**Expected Output**:  
Lists of common HTTP methods and status codes with descriptions and use cases.

### 1. Consume data from an API using Command Line (curl)

**Objective**: Learn how to interact with APIs using `curl`, a command-line tool for transferring data.

- Install `curl` and fetch data from an API.
- Use advanced options like setting headers and sending POST requests.
- Understand API response formats and status codes.

**Expected Output**:  
Successfully fetch and manipulate data from an API using `curl`. Example API: JSONPlaceholder.

### 2. Consuming and processing data from an API using Python

**Objective**: Use Python's `requests` library to fetch and process API data.

- Fetch data from an API.
- Parse JSON responses.
- Save the parsed data into a CSV file using Python’s `csv` module.

**Expected Output**:  
A Python script that fetches API data and stores it in a CSV file.

### 3. Develop a Simple API using Python's `http.server` Module

**Objective**: Use Python's built-in `http.server` module to build a basic API.

- Set up an HTTP server using `http.server`.
- Implement basic routes (GET, POST) and return JSON data.
- Handle different endpoints and return appropriate status codes.

**Expected Output**:  
A simple web API that returns static JSON data and handles 404 errors for undefined endpoints.

### 4. Develop a Simple API using Flask

**Objective**: Use the Flask framework to create a more advanced API.

- Set up and run a Flask application.
- Define routes for different endpoints.
- Serve JSON data dynamically.
- Handle POST requests to add new data to the API.

**Expected Output**:  
A Flask API that serves user data and handles both GET and POST requests with proper routing and error handling.

### 5. API Security and Authentication Techniques

**Objective**: Learn how to secure APIs using basic and token-based authentication (JWT).

- Implement Basic Authentication with Flask.
- Secure API endpoints using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Implement role-based access control.

**Expected Output**:  
A Flask API secured with JWT tokens, role-based access, and basic authentication.
