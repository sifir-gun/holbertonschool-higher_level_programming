# Python - Classes and Objects

## Background Context

It’s VERY important that you read and understand all the material below. Experiment by yourself with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and play with it! Make sure you type (not copy-paste), test, and understand all the examples shown in the provided links.

## Resources

Read or watch:
- [Object Oriented Programming](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

### General Concepts
- What is OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)?
- “First-class everything”
- What is a class?
- What is an object and an instance?
- Difference between a class and an object/instance
- What is an attribute?
- How to use public, protected, and private attributes
- What is `self`?
- What is a method?
- What is the special `__init__` method and how to use it?
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding?
- What is a property?
- Difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- How to write Pythonic getters and setters in Python
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes
- What is the `__dict__` of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain?
- How does Python find the attributes of an object or class?
- How to use the `getattr` function

## Requirements

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Your code should follow the `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*) guidelines.
- Each module, class, and method must contain a docstring.
- Files must be executable.

## Project Tasks

### 0. My first square
Write an empty class `Square` that defines a square.
**Directory:** `python-classes`  
**File:** `0-square.py`

### 1. Square with size
Write a class `Square` that defines a square with a private instance attribute `size`.  
**Directory:** `python-classes`  
**File:** `1-square.py`

### 2. Size validation
Write a class `Square` that validates the `size` attribute.
**Directory:** `python-classes`  
**File:** `2-square.py`

### 3. Area of a square
Write a class `Square` that includes a method to calculate the area of the square.  
**Directory:** `python-classes`  
**File:** `3-square.py`

### 4. Access and update private attribute
Write a class `Square` that defines a getter and setter for the `size` attribute.  
**Directory:** `python-classes`  
**File:** `4-square.py`

### 5. Printing a square
Write a class `Square` that includes a method to print the square using the `#` character.
**Directory:** `python-classes`  
**File:** `5-square.py`

### 6. Coordinates of a square
Write a class `Square` that defines an additional attribute `position` and prints the square with coordinates.  
**Directory:** `python-classes`  
**File:** `6-square.py`

## More Info

Documentation is mandatory! Each module, class, and method must contain docstrings following Google Style Python Docstrings.
