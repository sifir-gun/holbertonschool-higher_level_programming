- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance?
- What is an attribute?
- What are and how to use public, protected, and private attributes?
- What is `self` in a class?
- What is a method in a class?
- What is the special `__init__` method and how to use it?
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding?
- What is a property in Python?
- What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python?
- What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python?
- What are the special `__str__` and `__repr__` methods and how to use them?
- What is the difference between `__str__` and `__repr__`?
- What is a class attribute?
- What is the difference between an object attribute and a class attribute?
- What is a class method?
- What is a static method?
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class?
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes?
- What is `__dict__` of a class or instance?

- How to use the `getattr` function?

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Project Structure
This project is focused on practicing Object-Oriented Programming in Python, specifically working with classes and objects.

### Tasks
0. **Simple Rectangle**
   - Write an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.

1. **Real definition of a rectangle**
   - Define a rectangle by its width and height.

2. **Area and Perimeter**
   - Add methods to compute the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

3. **String representation**
   - Print the rectangle with the character `#`.

4. **Eval is magic**
   - Use `repr()` to recreate a new instance of the rectangle.

5. **Detect instance deletion**
   - Print a message when an instance of the rectangle is deleted.

6. **How many instances**
   - Track the number of instances of the class.

7. **Change representation**
   - Allow customization of the symbol used for printing the rectangle.

8. **Compare rectangles**
   - Create a method to compare rectangles based on their area.

9. **A square is a rectangle**
   - Define a class method to create a square as a special rectangle.
